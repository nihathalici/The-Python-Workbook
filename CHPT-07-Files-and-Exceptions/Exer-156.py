Exercise 156: Sum a Collection of Numbers

Create a program that sums all of the numbers entered by the user while ignoring
any input that is not a valid number. Your program should display the current sum
after each number is entered. It should display an appropriate message after each
non-numeric input, and then continue to sum any additional numbers entered by the
user. Exit the program when the user enters a blank line. Ensure that your program
works correctly for both integers and floating-point numbers.

# Author's solution:
##
# Compute the sum of numbers entered by the user, ignoring non-numeric input.
#
# Read the first line of input from the user
line = input("Enter a number: ")
total = 0

# Keep reading until the user enters a blank line
while line != "":
    try:
        # Try and convert the line to a number
        num = float(line)
        # If the conversion succeeds then add it to the total and display it
        total = total + num
        print("The total is now", total)
    except ValueError:
        # Display an error message before going on to read the next value
        print("That wasnâ€™t a number.")

    # Read the next number
    line = input("Enter a number: ")

# Display the total
print("The grand total is", total)
