Exercise 167: Spell Checker

A spell checker can be a helpful tool for people who struggle to spell words correctly.
In this exercise, you will write a program that reads a file and displays all of the words
in it that are misspelled. Misspelled words will be identified by checking each word
in the file against a list of known words. Any words in the userâ€™s file that do not
appear in the list of known words will be reported as spelling mistakes.
