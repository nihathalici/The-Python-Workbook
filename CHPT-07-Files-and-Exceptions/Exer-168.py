Exercise 168: Repeated Words

Spelling mistakes are only one of many different kinds of errors that might appear in
a written work. Another error that is common for some writers is a repeated word. For
example, an author might inadvertently duplicate a word, as shown in the following
sentence:

   At least one value must be entered
   entered in order to compute the average.

Some word processors will detect this error and identify it when a spelling or grammar
check is performed.

In this exercise you will write a program that detects repeated words in a text file.
When a repeated word is found your program should display a message that contains
the line number and the repeated word. Ensure that your program correctly handles
the case where the same word appears at the end of one line and the beginning of the
following line, as shown in the previous example. The name of the file to examine will
be provided as the programâ€™s only command line argument. Display an appropriate
error message if the user fails to provide a command line argument, or if an error
occurs while processing the file.

""" aldotele's note:
initially did not manage to count duplicates between end of line and start of the next line.
The problem was adding the empty last_word variable inside the first loop. Doing so, when analysing
a new line, the variable was empty again. 
Placing the variable outside both loops, the program always manages to store the previous word
and compare it with the next encountered word.
