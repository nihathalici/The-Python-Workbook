Exercise 161: Whatâ€™s that Element Again?

Write a program that reads a file containing information about chemical elements
and stores it in one or more appropriate data structures. Then your program should
read and process input from the user. If the user enters an integer then your program
should display the symbol and name of the element with the number of protons
entered. If the user enters a non-integer value then your program should display the
number of protons for the element with that name or symbol. Your program should
display an appropriate error message if no element exists for the name, symbol or
number of protons entered. Continue to read input from the user until a blank line is
entered.
