Exercise 170: Missing Comments
(Solved, 48 Lines)
When one writes a function, it is generally a good idea to include a comment that
outlines the functionâ€™s purpose, its parameters and its return value. However, some-
times comments are forgotten, or left out by well-intentioned programmers that plan
to write them later but then never get around to it.
Create a Python program that reads one or more Python source files and identifies
functions that are not immediately preceded by a comment.

# Author's solution:

# Find and display the names of Python functions that are not immediately preceded by a
# comment.

        # As we move through the file we need to keep a copy of the previous line so that we
        # can check to see if it starts with a comment character. We also need to keep track
        # of the line number within the file.
