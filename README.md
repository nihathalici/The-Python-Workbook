# The Python Workbook
This is my repo following the book "The Python Workbook" by Ben Stephenson.

Synopsis taken from the book:
"This book contains 186 exercises that span a variety of academic disciplines and everyday situations.(...) No matter what other resources you use with this book, if any, reading the chapters, completing the exercises, and studying the provided solutions will enhance your programming ability."
