Exercise 184: Flatten a List

Pythonâ€™s lists can contain other lists. When one list occurs inside another the inner
list is said to be nested inside the outer list. Each of the inner lists nested within
the outer list may also contain nested lists, and those lists may contain additional
nested lists to any depth.

Write a function that implements the recursive flattening algorithm described
previously. Your function will take one argument, which is the list to flatten, and
it will return one result, which is the flattened list. Include a main program that
demonstrates that your function successfully flattens the list shown earlier in this
problem, as well as several others.

# Author's solution:
##
# Use recursion to flatten a list that may contain nested lists.
#
## Flatten a list so that all nested lists are removed
# @param data the list to flatten
# @return a flattened version of data
def flatten(data):
    # If data is empty then there is no work to do
    if data == []:
        return []

    # If the first element in data is a list
    if type(data[0]) == list:
        # Flatten the first element and flatten
        # the remaining elements in the list
        return flatten(data[0]) + flatten(data[1:])
    else:
        # The first element in data is not a list so only the remaining
        # elements in the list need to be flattened
        return [data[0]] + flatten(data[1:])
    

# Demonstrate the flatten function

    print(flatten( [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, [6, 7]]], [[[8], 9], [10]]] ))
