Exercise 181: Possible Change

Create a program that determines whether or not it is possible to construct a particular
total using a specific number of coins. For example, it is possible to have a total of
$1.00 using four coins if they are all quarters. However, there is no way to have a
total of $1.00 using 5 coins. Yet it is possible to have $1.00 using 6 coins by using
3 quarters, 2 dimes and a nickel. Similarly, a total of $1.25 can be formed using 5
coins or 8 coins, but a total of $1.25 cannot be formed using 4, 6 or 7 coins.
Your program should read both the dollar amount and the number of coins from
the user. Then it should display a clear message indicating whether or not the entered
dollar amount can be formed using the number of coins indicated. Assume the exis-
tence of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies when completing this problem. Your
solution must use recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
