Exercise 183: Element Sequences

Some people like to play a game that constructs a sequence of chemical elements
where each element in the sequence begins with the last letter of its predecessor.
For example, if a sequence begins with Hydrogen, then the next element must be an
element that begins with N, such as Nickel. The element following Nickel must begin
with L, such as Lithium. The element sequence that is constructed cannot contain
any duplicates. When played alone the goal of the game is to constructed the longest
possible sequence of elements. When played with two players, the goal is to select
an element that leaves your opponent without an option to add to the sequence.

Write a program that reads the name of an element from the user and uses a
recursive function to find the longest sequence of elements that begins with that
value. Display the sequence once it has been computed. Ensure that your program
responds in a reasonable way if the user does not enter a valid element name.

HINT: It may take your program up to two minutes to find the longest sequence
for some elements. As a result, you might want to use elements like Molyb-
denum and Magnesium as your first test cases. Each has a longest sequence
that is only 8 elements long which your program should find in a fraction of a
second.
