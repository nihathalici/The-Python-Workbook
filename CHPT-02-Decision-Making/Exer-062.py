Exercise 62: Roulette Payouts

A roulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are red, and two
are green. The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are numbered 1,
3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30 32, 34 and 36. The remaining integers
between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces.

Many different bets can be placed in roulette. We will only consider the following
subset of them in this exercise:

* Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
* Red versus Black
* Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for even)
* 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36

Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using Pythonâ€™s
random number generator. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets
that must be payed. For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:

The spin resulted in 13...
Pay 13
Pay Black
Pay Odd
Pay 1 to 18

If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display Pay 0
or Pay 00 without any further output.
